# Programming-Theory

This project is a 3D Unity game for the Junior Programmer Learning Pathway on learn.unity.com, the intent of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of
the 4 pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction) and employ them successfully while creating a working game prototype. The core scripts
of this project are commented to indicate which pillar they demonstrate, as well as where and how.

The Game:

This is a 3D Pong game built with help from This Is GameDev's tutorial on youtube. I took the base game and made modifications to it to add Powerups which trigger
when the ball in play collides with the Powerup prefab object. The Powerups utilize inheritence to deliver commands using a base script as a model. The rackets
are able to be assigned to player or computer control, with the game able to be played fully by the commputer using a simle follow Z position method.

Player controls: W and S for the left hand racket, Up arrow and Down arrow for the right hand racket. Spacebar starts the game. Pressing Escape key in game will open
the options menu, where you can control audio levels and quit back to the title screen.

You are free to use any part of this repo for your own purposes. If you create something using what you've read here, consider letting me know so I can check out what
you've done. I am a student and I would love to see what you make.
